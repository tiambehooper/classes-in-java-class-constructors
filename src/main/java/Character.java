/**
 * The Character class represents a character in a video game. Characters have
 * names, character types (such as wizard, orc, thief, spy, etc), health, and
 * power. Power is the amount of damage a character deals when they attack
 * another Character.
 * <p>
 * Your job is to add these four properties to this class, along with a
 * constructor to setup the Character's initial state. You will also need to add
 * an attack() method so that a Character may attack and deal damage to another
 * character. Finally, you will override the toString() method so that object
 * can describe itself.
 * <p>
 * Follow the instructions in the to-do items listed below.
